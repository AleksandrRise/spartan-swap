# Spartan Swap 🟦🟨
Spartan Swap is a web app for **San José State University students** to find the classes they need and either:
- **Swap** a seat with another student (e.g., *Biology ↔ Math*), or
- **Take** a class seat directly when it’s available.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Spartan Swap is a student-built project and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by San José State University**.

## Why Spartan Swap?
Getting the right classes at SJSU can be stressful—waitlists move slowly, schedules conflict, and the “perfect section” disappears instantly. Spartan Swap is designed to make student-to-student class exchanging **simple, fast, and organized**.
